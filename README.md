# BeagleChoo
BeagleChoo is an experimental model train controller using BeagleBone, more specifically a BeagleBone Blue. The idea is to
control a [Märklin 60116 Digital Connector Box](https://www.maerklin.de/en/products/details/article/60116/) through its 
front panel connector, make some of this capability available over the network and enable technical experimentation.

This is work in progress and far from complete. You have been warned!

## Background

I run a Märklin M-track model railroad, and would like digital control with it. The full-blown 
Märklin contollers are more expensive than the budget allows, so I am looking for a more
affordable option. Also, there is a lot of unrealized potential for STEM education in model
trains, particularly if you combine it with Open Source, modern embedded computing and 
building electronic hardware. This project tries to explore some of these areas.

### The Märklin 60116 Digital Connector Box

The [Märklin 60116 Digital Connector Box](https://www.maerklin.de/en/products/details/article/60116/) 
provides an attractive and cost-effective interface to a model railroad. It is designed 
to be used in conjunction with a [Märklin 60657 Mobile Station (also known as "MS2")](https://www.maerklin.de/en/products/details/article/60657).
The MS2 is a handheld controller that talks to the 60116 over a CAN link, using a format that
[has been published by Märklin (in German)](https://www.maerklin.de/fileadmin/media/service/software-updates/cs2CAN-Protokoll-2_0.pdf).
The 60116 works as a track protocol processor. The protocol spec calls this a Gleisformat Prozessor,
and I will use GFP as an acronym in this document. The GFP translates CAN bus messages from the
system or GUI processor to one of the communication formats on the track. The formats supported by
the GFP include the MM2, mfx (sometimes also called M4) and DCC formats. Not all of these formats
are documented.

The physical connection to the CAN bus is via one of two available 10-pin mini-DIN connectors
on the front panel. Unfortunately these connectors are really hard to obtain, so I will take
some liberties and solder directly to the PCB.

### BeagleBone Blue
![Image of BeagleBone Blue](https://beagleboard.org/static/images/250px/beagle-blue-pck.png)

The [BeagleBone Blue](http://beagleboard.org/blue) is a member of the BeagleBone family of single board 
computers, and it is focused on robotics. It basically consists of a BeagleBone with an integrated
[Robotics Cape](https://beagleboard.org/capes#robotics). Software support for the rebotics-related
components is available via [librobotcontrol](https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/librobotcontrol).

Compared to other members of the BeagleBoard family, the BeagleBone Blue is unfortunately somewhat 
underdocumented, particularly in its differences in pinout and connectivity. The reason I am 
using the BeagleBone Blue for this project is that I had one laying around that wasn't used for
anything else at the time, and it conveniently has a CAN interface chip already available 
on the board. It also has a lot of hardware drivers and I/O brought out to connectors, and has
a lot of potential for other related experiments. But in principle, all of this could be adapted
to other (most likely cheaper) members of the BeagleBone family.

While the BeagleBone Blue would be capable enough to also include the GFP functionality,
I will make no attempt to do so. The unit is sold at a fair price for the functionality
available, and there is very little point in replicating all these capabilities. 

### System Overview
The system is connected as follows: The GFP is connected to power (18 V DC, 2-3 A), the railroad track,
and to the BeagleBone Blue via the CAN connector.
